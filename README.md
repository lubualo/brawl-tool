# Brawl Tool - Trophies Calculator

## Overview
**Brawl Tool** is a React + Next.js application designed to calculate trophies dynamically for the popular game *Brawl Stars*. The tool allows players to determine trophies based on consecutive wins and vice versa, providing a simple, user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Dynamic Updates:** Calculates trophies in real-time based on win streaks or desired trophy count.
- **Customizable Inputs:** Enter either the win streak or the trophy target, and the tool automatically calculates the other field.
- **Responsive UI:** Styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn components for a clean, modern look.
- **Accessibility:** Designed with accessibility in mind using ARIA-friendly components.
